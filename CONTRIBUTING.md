## Building and testing the library

```sh
# install dependencies
yarn install

# run the tests
yarn test

# build the library
yarn build
```

## Using `npm link` or `yarn link`

In order to use the library locally on another project, you can use the `npm`|`yarn` link feature.

1. Head to the built package and inform npm|yarn about it:

```sh
cd dist/packages/{package-name}
yarn link # or npm link
```

2. Go to your project and link the package:

```sh
yarn link @jscutlery/{package-name} # or npm link @jscutlery/{package-name}
```
